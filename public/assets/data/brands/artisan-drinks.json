Implementing robust tracking systems would help align efforts with long-term goals and demonstrate progress to stakeholders. The website also faces issues with site navigation, particularly due to its diverse product range. Simplifying the layout and adding intuitive filters could enhance user experience. Mobile optimization is crucial, as many customers shop via smartphones. Improving product descriptions with details on ingredients, sourcing, and pairing suggestions could engage customers more. Lastly, clearer shipping and delivery information, including costs and timelines, would improve transparency, especially during peak seasons.",

Optimizing the mobile experience through responsive design and mobile-friendly features will ensure seamless browsing and purchasing. Product information can be improved with detailed descriptions, ingredient lists, sourcing info, and cocktail pairing suggestions, supported by high-quality imagery. Visual consistency should be maintained with unified design elements and balanced layouts. Shipping and logistics can be clarified with transparent policies and real-time order tracking.
